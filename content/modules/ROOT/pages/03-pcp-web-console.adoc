== Utilizing PCP with the Web Console

One of the easiest ways to observe the performance status of a RHEL
server is via the Web Console, based on the upstream Cockpit project. As
the web console is built to be modular, you will need to install the
plugin for PCP:

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf install -y cockpit-pcp
----

Then start the web console:

[source,bash,run]
----
systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
----

Click on the `+RHEL Web Console+` tab.

.web console

Log into the Web Console with the following credentials.

Username

[source,bash]
----
rhel
----

Password

[source,bash]
----
redhat
----

Give yourself `+administrative access+` by clicking on
`+Turn on administrative access+`.

On the dashboard, you will see the CPU and Memory usage of your system
update live. To dive in deeper, you can click on
`+View metrics and history+`

The services, processes, and disks are hyperlinks that take you either
to more detailed graphics, the appropriate web console screen, or even
the system logs. This allows for a more unified troubleshooting
experience.

In the final step, you will start several processes and utilize the PCP
suite to observe its impact on system resources.
