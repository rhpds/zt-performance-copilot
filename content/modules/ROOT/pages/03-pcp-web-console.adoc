== Utilizing PCP with the Web Console

One of the easiest ways to observe the performance status of a RHEL server is via the Web Console, based on the upstream Cockpit project.

Click on the `+RHEL Webconsole+` tab.

Log into the Web Console with the following credentials.

Username

[source,js]
----
rhel
----

Password

[source,js,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
{bastion_ssh_password}
----

Give yourself `+administrative access+` by clicking on
`+Turn on administrative access+`.

On the dashboard, you will see the CPU and Memory usage of your system
update live. To dive in deeper, you can click on
`+View metrics and history+`

The services, processes, and disks are hyperlinks that take you either to more detailed graphics, the appropriate web console screen, or even the system logs. This allows for a more unified troubleshooting experience.

In the final step, you will start several processes and utilize the PCP
suite to observe its impact on system resources.
